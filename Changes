Revision history for module SQLite:DB.

     - commit and rollback was returning '1' even with errors occuring.
     - created @transaction_errors var to hold all errors of an transcation
       since each exec creates it's own error, and at the end, if the commit
       command itself does not had an error, it would consider all transaction
       sucessfull, wich is wrong.
